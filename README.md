# Banking App

## Overview

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in with predefined credentials.

- **Transaction History**: A history of all transactions is stored and displayed.
- **Local Storage**: All user data is stored in `localStorage` to persist between sessions.
- **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out to prevent unauthorized access.
